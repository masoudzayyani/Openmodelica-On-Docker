# Openmodelica-On-Docker
Our goal in this project was to run examples of Openmodelica applications easily applicable to the user in any environment with Docker technology so that the end-user can quickly run their Openmodelica applications at any time and place.

for run application could first create images from client and server and then run command for docker-compose for run application and run your Openmodelica programs.

also, we put images on these addresses:

docker pull masoudzayyani/image-server

docker pull masoudzayyani/image-server

and for the run app could use this command in the main folder:
docker-compose up

and then in the browser open this address:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
